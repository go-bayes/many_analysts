Review for “Causal models are needed...” 

The motivation of this article is great, and while its execution is reasonable given the constraints of the commentary format, I would encourage the authors to clean it up in a few key ways. First, I should note that it comes across as hastily put together and lacking consideration for the reader.  For example, we should not have to read what appear to be unmodified xtable tables; we should be able to immediate interpret what the estimates are for in Tables B1-B4. Also, the figures are unreadable without being able to zoom in. The authors should assume readers will use paper to read their contribution. Other examples abound (see below). I would also encourage the authors to expand this to a full-length article because it is clear that it requires a little more room to breathe. That said, the commentary might benefit for some sharper targeting. The commentary should eventually get published, but it needs to guide the reader better: 1) tighten up the framing; 2) lend a bit more consideration to an audience you're trying to convince; your motivations are clear to me, but I doubt they would be to someone who doesn't already know them; 3) stitch the materials together a bit tighter; make sure each part is explicitly connected. 

Framing: 
The MARP project was an attempt to crowd-source analyses, the authors are doing the project and social science more broadly a service by focusing on causal inference. I’m completely sympathetic with the approach and motivation (in fact, the charge is more applicable to the social sciences in general, the field of the scientific study of religion more specifically). The authors don’t imply that the MARP project is guilty of adopting a “model free” approach, but it *might* come across that way given how the framing is a little negative (“...illustrate how a ‘model free’ approach can mislead...”). This might be a little clearer if the scope of criticism were widened (i.e., to also apply to social science more generally). 

Introduction: 
In a few ways, the introduction needs work (another example of its rushed style). First, it doesn’t obviously follow that “religion affects mental health” because it “remains a core feature of human life”. Second, the intro. enumerates three points that are neither introduced nor obviously related to one another. Initially, I thought it would help to say something along the lines of “Yet[,] inferring how religion affects mental health requires care [for at least three important reasons].” but I’m not sure if the following points are reasons for this care. Third, the second point requires some citations and/or precision. As it reads now, there are a few aphoristic truisms here (e.g., “Causality is dynamic”...”the interplay of religion and mental health depends on broader cultural, political...”) that aren’t helping us get to the point. Too much is going on in this paragraph for the relatively mundane point that things can be dynamic. 

Causal inference and models: 
Paragraphs 3-5 that describe the DAGs need a little attention. It’s a little misleading (perhaps more so to an outsider) to suggest that the MARP data can’t address the backdoor path in Fig. 1b; all it would take is thinking of a variable that would block it. If the MARP data (and our imagination) really can’t do it, some qualification is in order. It reads as unsolvable here for no apparent reason. In other words, the commentary is not presenting the virtues of DAGs very well. It’s tough to distill this large literature into a commentary, but the authors should be able to make things a little clearer, especially since their motivation is to convince readers that causal inference really is the way to go here. 

As mentioned, Figure 1 is simply unreadable. Even if each panel were larger and more legible, the DAGs are quite messy and the key on the side of the graphs is mysterious; we have 3 circles, one square, and three colors/tones. What do they mean and how are they helping us? 

Why are age, SES, education, sex, etc. included here? Yes, there is a large literature that predicts their important (cite them), but since they aren’t discussed here, it seems like an unnecessary and untheorized set of variables that would only confound the estimates even more, given the model. 

The y-axis labels in figure 2 are unreadable. The country-level plots probably aren’t necessary anyway, since that’s not really the focus here.   

Statistical model:   
Justifying the priors here might be useful. 

Appendices: 
code for simulations mod2 and mod3 are identical 

caption in Figure C1 is probably too preachy for a figure; the figure does not clearly convey the idea that “Causal assumptions are needed for causal inference”. The paper needs a bit more pedagogical flair in text to bring readers to appreciate this point. 

Details: 
footnote 1: powers[.] Perhaps cite Wallace (1966) or Jensen (2019) for this definition? It’s helpful to be clear about this, but there are many out there (and plenty of folks who have thought hard about this). 
line 40 pg. 3: “makes a start”. colloquial. 
line 25 pg. 4: “Recall that...” I missed the introduction to this point. 
line 12-13 pg. 5: “these interpretations, we...” something’s not right here. 
line 38 pg. 5: “being drawn to God when anxious serves functions”. I get what this sentence means, but this construction is a little awkward. Perhaps rephrase.
